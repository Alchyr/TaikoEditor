consider improving loading more


Would be nice if theres a timing tool that automatically adjusts the BPM of a red line, and the red line before it so that the nearest barline tick intersects cleanly with it. Would just be nice on those drifting BPM maps


Pool arraylists?

add fps/vsync/stuff settings to in-editor


Need to test - multiple clients
Hard to test - synchronization code when changes are made at the same time before receiving change from other




MAJOR:
Bezier Curve SV
- Select x green points as the initial anchor points, can then adjust up/down for green lines, and add/adjust more points?
 on a special screen before generating sv?
 Simpler option - https://cubic-bezier.com/ this style



MAYBE:
Add scaling so lower resolutions can see a reasonable amount of stuff


MINOR:
In volume mode of view: Also display sample set on lines that change it and have a way to add a sampleset change?
Maybe tools? "Set Sampleset"
Maybe just a separate tool for each sampleset?
Hovering will highlight the current target area, from previous line to next line
Unless view has a selection, in which case it will be just from selected lines

Sort difficulties by difficulty?

Snaps may not generate correctly 100% of the time?
- should be fixed. Was an issue with snaps that aren't initially generated being removed from other sets when generated later.
It was silly.




EXTRA STUFF:
Alternate song select - Simply file open dialog, without preloading all maps (= no load time)

Limited selection - ex. only select kats or only select dons

save as tja?


NOTE:
Because snaps store precise positions and timing points are placed at integer positions, they may intermittently overlap/unoverlap depending on song position.
Anything that is placed on a snap will round using truncation.
Snaps are calculated based on the method used by lazer in its open source code.
As such, snap generation *does not* match live, and thus may result in 1ms unsnaps.


BUGS:
Sometimes audio will not play the first time you seek. Seeking again fixes this.
Changing speed before playing the audio at least once will result in audio issues. Seeking or pausing and playing again will fix this.
Audio - Fixed by loading and playing the music automatically in menu? Could maybe still accomplish the issue by selecting map very fast?
