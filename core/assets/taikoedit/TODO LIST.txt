LOADING SUCKS MAKE IT BETTER.
Loading takes way too long on some pcs or if you have a huge amount of maps.

MAJOR:
- Existing break periods will not be updated, resulting in breaks over gameplay which is Unrankable

- Settings menu


MAYBE:
Add scaling so lower resolutions can see a reasonable amount of stuff


MINOR:
Add toggle for effect view to swap between sv and volume editing?

Sliders are not the correct length in gameplay view when SV is not 1.0x

Add view starts on whatever difficulty was opened last? Current primary difficulty?
Sort difficulties by difficulty? Maybe.


Selection tool shift + click to select all between currently selection and clicked point
If on left, from left end of selection, on right, from right end of selection (doesn't affect existing selection)
If in the middle, left middle: Selects from left side. Right middle, selects from right side. (smaller side)

Difficulty choosing/creating/menu
    - Partially complete. Todo: New difficulty creation. Difficulty Settings Menu.

Double-click to jump to an object

ability to configure placement of objects



NOTE - Timing generation does not match stable?
I think stable generates one beat at a time, skipping to the next beat directly rather than incrementally



EXTRA STUFF:
Alternate song select - Simply file open dialog, without preloading all maps (= no load time)
Loading osu! skins

Snaps beyond 1/16? Using a custom set of snappings?

Limited selection - ex. only select kats or only select dons

save as tja?


NOTE:
Because snaps store precise positions and timing points are placed at integer positions, they may intermittently overlap/unoverlap depending on song position.
Anything that is placed on a snap will round using truncation.
Snaps are calculated based on the method used by lazer in its open source code.
As such, snap generation *does not* match live, and thus may result in 1ms unsnaps.


BUGS:
Sometimes audio will not play the first time you seek. Seeking again fixes this.
Seems to be kind of fixed?
Changing speed before playing the audio at least once will result in audio issues. Seeking or pausing and playing again will fix this.
Seems ok?
When the snap divisor is set to 0 (none) the program is much (?) laggier. May simply be a visual illusion thing.
