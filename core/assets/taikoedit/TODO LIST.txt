LOADING SUCKS MAKE IT BETTER.
Loading takes way too long on some pcs or if you have a huge amount of maps.
- Should be improved?
Now saves database, which should increase speed on subsequent loads on non-solid state drives.
On SSD probably almost no difference, but on a hard drive should? make a very large difference due to far less file operations.
- Should be extremely significantly improved by dedicating more time to loading during load screens, as well as improvement to file loading for maps.

MAJOR:
Bezier Curve SV
- Select x green points as the initial anchor points, can then adjust up/down for green lines, and add/adjust more points?
 on a special screen before generating sv?
 Simpler option - https://cubic-bezier.com/ this style

Progress:
Breaks are displayed on timeline and in object view.
Right click to delete.
In progress: Left click ends to drag them. - done
Automatic updating:
Removal - Works?
Adjust a long object - Works, except for the overlapping objects part kinda, but I'm not that worried about that.
Adding -
    Working?
    Probably still some bugs if you do weird things, but mostly it should work.



- Kiai - Done?


MAYBE:
Add scaling so lower resolutions can see a reasonable amount of stuff


MINOR:
In volume mode of view: Also display sample set on lines that change it and have a way to add a sampleset change?
Maybe tools? "Set Sampleset"
Maybe just a separate tool for each sampleset?
Hovering will highlight the current target area, from previous line to next line
Unless view has a selection, in which case it will be just from selected lines

Sort difficulties by difficulty?

Snaps may not generate correctly 100% of the time?
- should be fixed. Was an issue with snaps that aren't initially generated being removed from other sets when generated later.
It was silly.




EXTRA STUFF:
Alternate song select - Simply file open dialog, without preloading all maps (= no load time)

Limited selection - ex. only select kats or only select dons

save as tja?


NOTE:
Because snaps store precise positions and timing points are placed at integer positions, they may intermittently overlap/unoverlap depending on song position.
Anything that is placed on a snap will round using truncation.
Snaps are calculated based on the method used by lazer in its open source code.
As such, snap generation *does not* match live, and thus may result in 1ms unsnaps.


BUGS:
Sometimes audio will not play the first time you seek. Seeking again fixes this.
Changing speed before playing the audio at least once will result in audio issues. Seeking or pausing and playing again will fix this.
Audio - Fixed by loading and playing the music automatically in menu? Could maybe still accomplish the issue by selecting map very fast?
When the snap divisor is set to 0 (none) the program is much (?) laggier. May simply be a visual illusion thing. - fixed due to dumb snap generation code
