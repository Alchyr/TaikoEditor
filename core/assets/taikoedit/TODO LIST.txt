consider improving loading more


Would be nice if theres a timing tool that automatically adjusts the BPM of a red line, and the red line before it so that the nearest barline tick intersects cleanly with it. Would just be nice on those drifting BPM maps


Pool arraylists?


CO-OP EDITING

Cannot select same objects.
Issue - attempting to locate objects for a change when those objects are in the middle of being dragged

REPLACE "HIDE" with "ALTERNATIVE" - gives a "placeholder" object, the properties of which will be displayed so long as condition is true
will fix issues with graph stuff
and then don't need to do any extra manual rendering
make sure rendering of objects/effect points is using accessor methods

*DO NOT REPLACE
hiding is necessary for horizontal movement stuff
alternative would only be used for vertical drag... and only for effect view.
Come up with something better for having temporarily displayed green lines.
Maybe a "tempRenderLine" method in EffectView. Receives "targetLine" (can be null) and "renderLine"
if targetLine != null, store in map. When rendering lines, get from map. If not null, render that line instead.

If targetLine is null, store in a list, and render them separately.

The list and map are cleared each frame.






MAJOR:
Bezier Curve SV
- Select x green points as the initial anchor points, can then adjust up/down for green lines, and add/adjust more points?
 on a special screen before generating sv?
 Simpler option - https://cubic-bezier.com/ this style



MAYBE:
Add scaling so lower resolutions can see a reasonable amount of stuff


MINOR:
In volume mode of view: Also display sample set on lines that change it and have a way to add a sampleset change?
Maybe tools? "Set Sampleset"
Maybe just a separate tool for each sampleset?
Hovering will highlight the current target area, from previous line to next line
Unless view has a selection, in which case it will be just from selected lines

Sort difficulties by difficulty?

Snaps may not generate correctly 100% of the time?
- should be fixed. Was an issue with snaps that aren't initially generated being removed from other sets when generated later.
It was silly.




EXTRA STUFF:
Alternate song select - Simply file open dialog, without preloading all maps (= no load time)

Limited selection - ex. only select kats or only select dons

save as tja?


NOTE:
Because snaps store precise positions and timing points are placed at integer positions, they may intermittently overlap/unoverlap depending on song position.
Anything that is placed on a snap will round using truncation.
Snaps are calculated based on the method used by lazer in its open source code.
As such, snap generation *does not* match live, and thus may result in 1ms unsnaps.


BUGS:
Sometimes audio will not play the first time you seek. Seeking again fixes this.
Changing speed before playing the audio at least once will result in audio issues. Seeking or pausing and playing again will fix this.
Audio - Fixed by loading and playing the music automatically in menu? Could maybe still accomplish the issue by selecting map very fast?
When the snap divisor is set to 0 (none) the program is much (?) laggier. May simply be a visual illusion thing. - fixed due to dumb snap generation code
