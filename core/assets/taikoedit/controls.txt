BASICS:
Click stuff to do things.


Escape to exit.

Navigation:
Click on timeline to jump.
Space to play/pause.
Left/Right arrows or z/x to move to previous/next snap.
Ctrl+left/right arrows/z/x to move to previous/next bookmark.

Editor Controls:
Numbers for hotkeys to swap tools.
wertyuiop: instant use tools starting from index 2. Not all tools support instant use. In fact, only one does.
    For placing objects, w and e will place a don/kat at the current position. If objects are selected, it will convert them to dons/kats instead.
q - toggle finisher lock (makes placed objects finishers). Pressing q while objects are selected will convert them to/from finishers instead.
Holding Shift while placing dons/kats/sliders will make them finishers.
Mouse to use tools.
Right click to delete things.
Up/Down arrows to change playback rate. Speed changing was done through a lazy method, so pitch is also affected.
Ctrl+a - select all
ctrl+c - copy selection
ctrl+x - cut selection
` (~ key) - clear selection
ctrl+v - paste
ctrl+b - add bookmark at current position
ctrl+g - reverse selection
ctrl+alt+r - resnap selection - TEST FEATURE, I would not rely on this.
ctrl+n or top right button - open a new view
ctrl+s - save
ctrl+z - undo
ctrl+y - redo
delete/backspace - delete selection, or if nothing is selected, delete object near the current time.

ctrl+scroll wheel to change snaps
shift+scroll wheel to change zoom
Scroll wheel can also be used to navigate through song.
If there are enough views to enable view scrolling, the scroll wheel will do that instead.

Selection tool:
Click an object to select it. Clicking directly on an object and dragging it will move it.
Clicking and dragging not directly on an object will select a range.

You can hold alt while dragging an object to ignore snaps. No idea why you'd want this, maybe for moving a green line? Idk, it was less than a line of code so I did it.


Other:
- and = to adjust offset. Some songs may not play with the correct offset. Use this to adjust. Hold ctrl to increase how much offset is adjusted by.
I can never remember which way positive/negative numbers are supposed to go so if they're opposite how they should be tell me x d
(I think I have it backwards right now.)
if sfx are late, use +. Early, use -.
